		<h2>Husband changed me, how to behave?</h2>
		<h3><i><b>Angelina, 21 y.o.</i></b></h3>
		<p>The husband confessed to treason, but the worst thing was that he said that he loved her !!! We had a daughter a year ago, at first everything was fine,
		then he began to work more and come tired, in short, he was at first after 11, then after 12, we are with him for 10 years, and have only been married for 2 years,
		and we always had a very trusting relationship to each other, and he himself is very honest and never lies,
		I know him well, but my daughter was born here and I was very passionate and did not notice any changes in him, usually I always see that something is wrong with him, and that I have eyes on his soul,
		and here, and I did not think that he could change, because we both wanted a child, and he had even more,
		I was always a party girl and did not like to sit at home, but here I am sitting for a year now.</p>
		
		<p>In short, I repented, but now I do not know how to live with this, of course Im not going to leave him, because it is unreasonable, and because I love him, but I am more worried,
		how can I live knowing that he lied to me, and yet he does not tell me who she is, and I generally have many questions for him, but he does not say anything, he says that the topic is closed,
		that he is very scandalous, and that he wants to be with us, after he confessed to me, the next day he broke up with her, but this is in his words, but he began to come now earlier, but I do not know now
		what time he finishes, how much he earns, I do not know what is in my head and I really care about it.</p>
		
		<p>The husband is in itself a very secretive and silent person, and from it the principle is very hard to pull out.
		And now he just is silent, comes home from work, sits down in the kitchen and is silent, then comes, lies down and falls asleep, and I only get worse every day, I certainly am not discouraged, and always keep my nose to the top, and
		even when he confessed to me, I reacted quite calmly, not screaming.</p>

		<h2>Mother-in-law climbs</h2>
		<h3><i><b>Alex, 31 y.o.</i></b></h3>
		<p>I did not think that I would write here, but now the time came when I was standing at the crossroads.
		I am 31, wife 35, child 6 months. We live in the apartment of the father-in-law five minutes from her family. Before the wedding and the first months of the wedding, everything seemed to be quite good. Joint interesting life, travel, movies, dominoes and more.
		As soon as the wife became pregnant, she herself began to change a little, and the mother-in-law began to show persevering interest in us. The closer to childbirth, the more often she was with us, the more often she called her wife and taught how to behave, what to eat, what doctor she would like to check.
		Yes, you know, the age of his wife is already critical in terms of childbirth, so I spat on everything, got married,
		and decided that we would live in the apartment of the test, and then we wll figure it out. At first I did not understand who was in charge of their family, but it turned out that it was the mother-in-law.
		The test is a henpecked and does not enjoy authority in the least.</p>
		
		<p>The delivery was incredibly complicated, the son was almost lost, nevertheless, they came out, a month later they were brought home. The mother-in-law hid for a long time, but it turned out that she had quit before giving birth to help her wife deal with her daughter.
		And then it started, she began to come when she wanted, without asking anything. Buy a lot of unnecessary things for the child, and demand money for it. At first, my timid comments, that we will buy everything ourselves, we will organize everything, she did not react at all.
		After I started to break down, already openly forbidding her to come and buy something, we entered into a conflict. One day I shouted at her, she at me and suggested that I throw out of her house, if something does not suit me. She comes to her daughter and grandson, and my opinion is not interesting.
		The wife avoided all these conflicts and did not interfere in the open.
		I said that we would move out on rented dwelling, my wife was hysterical, that there was not enough money anyway, but we would hang flippers on a removable vein.
		Net after loans and taxes remains about 40 tr.</p>
		
		<p>In general, these 6 months my wife meets me in a day / week with complaining about the mother-in-law that she climbs there, writes us arbitrarily to the doctors, teaches us where to go and what to do and what not to do. The very same is not able to neither to a baby, nor to dress, nor to sit with him for half a day, I am not talking all day.
		As soon as we leave for the store, in three hours it starts to call hysterically and say that we have abandoned the child, what we allow ourselves.
		I was tired of fighting, I just began to ignore her and told my wife that the mother-in-law would not come to us at all when I was at home. She does not come to my claims, says she feels sorry for her mother, she has the only meaning in her life - this is her grandson, she cannot just not let her
		This is the mother! The mother-in-law tells her about me, that I have a woman, that I will leave her, that I hide the money, that I want to squeeze out the apartment and other things I get on.
		She says she does not believe, but she still secretly checks me.</p>

		<p>My name is Sasha. For the first time I tried to commit suicide at eighteen.
		I bought a pack of sleeping pills and drank it. Slept a few hours, and then woke up.
		I could not understand, am I still alive or have I already died? I was very cold. Then I realized that it was necessary to contact a specialist with this problem.
		I started going to a psychologist, after a while I got to my feet. I wanted to live.</p>
		
		<p>After two years, everything happened again. I did not realize what I was doing. I do not even remember how I took the pills that the psychiatrist had prescribed for me. I slept a day, and then I was in the hospital. I was saved again.
		After a while it seemed that life was returning, but then everything only got worse. I got depressed. I stopped eating, slept poorly, and if I slept, I had nightmares. I stopped talking to friends, and they did not want to talk to me. I did not notice what was happening around. I did not pay attention to the cars, I almost got under the wheels several times, but I did not care.
		I have not seen anyone. Abandoned university. The world has ceased to exist. I completely went into myself.</p>
				
		<p>At that moment other personalities appeared inside me. Most of all I wanted to see them live. I was afraid to be alone.
		The characters were so different that I sometimes confused them when they talked to me. But at times ping-pong started in my head.
		They yelled all along. One tried to shout down the other. Personalities only multiplied, and I was starting to go crazy. I felt bad without them
		and worse with them.</p>
