			<h2>11 APRIL 2019 The book as a fashion accessory: Bella Thorn and her new reading of the total red</h2>
			<center><h4 style="width: 375px">From fiery red hair to scarlet manicure</h4></center>
			<p>When it comes to total color look, compromises are irrelevant - the actress Bella Thorne decided
			going to a party in honor of the opening of the New York hotel.
			Therefore, she wore a scarlet John Paul Ataker suit and shoes in tone, and also made a red manicure and picked up lipstick under it.
			The final touch of the image is a bright red wig, which builds total red into the absolute.</br> </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Bella Thornes desire to dress from head to toe in red is easy to explain: her book will be on sale in the US the other day
			The Life of a Wannabe Mogul, released in a red cover - it was her actress who used as an accessory.
			Perhaps, we have not yet seen a more elegant promo book novelty.</p>

			<h2>11 APRIL 2019 Tiffany & Co. released a new engagement ring Tiffany True</h2>
			<center><h4 style="width: 375px">A novelty that will become a classic</h4></center>
			<p>Cult of Tiffany & Co. most often associated with the classics of wedding jewelry traditions,
			therefore, the appearance of a new engagement ring, designed to become a new symbol of the brand, has become a significant event.
			Tiffany True is made in two versions: from platinum with a colorless diamond and from yellow
			gold with a fancy yellow diamond cut "cushion".
			For the new model, the masters developed a special faceting: the upper edge of the stone has a wide surface, which makes it possible to enhance its flickering.</br> </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Tiffany True is distinguished by several points. One of them is a frame in the form of an abstract "T",
			which frames a diamond.
			Instead of the traditional six valves, she has only four. In addition, it should be noted "landing"
			stone - it is located much lower in comparison with Tiffany Setting and looks more elegant.
			In general, the ring looks more compact, graphical and modern interpretation of the classic
			Tiffany Setting models, says Reed Krakoff.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Tiffany True will go on sale in April - just in time for the start of the wedding season.</p>

			<h2>12 APRIL 2019 From the subway podium: Naomi Campbell in the incredibly beautiful Valentino campaign</h2>
			<center><h4 style="width: 375px">Elegance and Femininity</h4></center>
			<p>At the Paris Fashion Week, Naomi Campbell came to the Valentino podium in a transparent dress, which caused a storm of applause in the show final.
			Now the <i>black panther</i> has appeared in the bag advertising campaign of the House.</br> </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Famous photographers Inez and Vinud went down with Naomi to the New York subway for filming and invited her to pose on the platforms.
			Admittedly, Valentino's clothes and bags look great in any entourage.</p>

			<h2>110 APRIL 2019 Life after Calvin Klein: designer Rough Simons opens a cafe</h2>
			<center><h4 style="width: 375px">What did one of the most talented fashion-creators of our time decide to do?</h4></center>
			<p>At the end of 2018, it was announced that Raf Simons was leaving the post of creative director Calvin Klein just two years after his appointment.
			What did the designer decide to do? The Belgian guru still has its own brand of men's clothing,
			under which he produces two collections a year and shows them in Paris.
			But is it really enough to realize all his indefatigable creative potential? Looks like no.</br> </p>
			<p></p>
			<center>

			</center>
			<p></p>
			<p>In a new interview with The Guardian, the designer said that he was waiting for him to come.
			It turned out that all his experience in fashion Simons decided to demonstrate in the furniture industry.
			And already cooperates with the Danish textile company Kvadrat.
			To present your interior works (including a snowstorm) at the prestigious Milan exhibition
			Salone del Mobile design, the designer decided to open a cafe.</p>

				<p>Cafe Citron from Jacquemus</p>
			</center>
			<p></p>
			<p>Raf, of course, is far from the first fashion-designer who develops gourmet themes.
			Suffice it to recall that last month Simon Port Jacqui opened his cafe in Paris.
			Soon the iconic bakery Marchesi 1824 in London will restore Prada.</p>
			
			<h2>10 APRIL 2019 The idea of El Fanning: celebrate a birthday in a pantsuit</h2>
			<center><h4 style="width: 375px">And be sure to pastel shades</h4></center>
			<p>Yesterday, April 9, actress and muse of the Miu Miu brand El Fanning turned 21 years old.
			To celebrate her coming of age, the star has chosen the most trending image of this
			spring - pastel-colored trouser suit.
			Under the double-breasted oversize-jacket, El wore a soft pink silk shirt and decided to do without large jewelry and other accessories.</p>
